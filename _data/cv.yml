        - Advisor. <a href="https://www.ee.ucla.edu/abeer-alwan/">Prof. Abeer Alwan</a>
        - Researched accent and dialect bias using NumPy, PyTorch, and HuggingFace with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, specifically on OpenAI Whisper and African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Primarily performed question-answering (QA) extraction using Hugging Face DeBERTa & Meta LLaMA-2 while fine-tuning Whisper with the Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) interview dataset. Improved QA performance by integrating LLaMA-2 compared to conventional QA models and saw 4% improvement with fine-tuning in word error rates (WER) and greater F1 score on AAVE.

        - Advisors. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/">Prof. Christian KÃ¤stner</a> and <a href="https://bvasiles.github.io/">Prof. Bogdan Vasilescu</a>
        - Developed Python NumPy/Pandas data-mining scripts to determine maintainers of the top 30,000 most popular GHTorrent GitHub repositories. Deduplicated ~5.6 million rows of contributor commit data by merging commit author aliases together and aggregated maintainers based on the definition of contributors responsible for top 80% of total project commits in a year. Identified ~584,000 distinct contributors, and ~110,000 maintainers to be interviewed to understand the motivations behind open-source software maintainers.
    - title: Undergraduate Robotics Development Researcher
      institution: University of California, Berkeley, California 
      year: June 2021 - Aug 2021
      description:
        - Advisor. <a href="https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/koushil/">Prof. Koushil Sreenath</a>
        - Independently developed a speech interface for a robotic guide dog to facilitate direct, vocal human-robot interaction utilizing Python with AWS Amazon Polly and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text APIs. Allowed for understanding vocal commands and a customizable wake word to activate the guide dog. Collaborated with the navigation team to ensure the interface could set navigation goals. Guide dog navigated based on the user's request by publishing predetermined coordinates to the guide dog's navigation target node. Allowed for the independence of guide dog by eliminating the need for a computer to manually send commands to the guide dog by integrating a speech interface into the existing infrastructure utilizing C++ and ROS. Presented research at multiple symposiums to a total of 300+ attendees and wrote a student paper that was cited by Google Research/DeepMind.
