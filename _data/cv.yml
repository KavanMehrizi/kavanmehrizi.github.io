      year: June 2023 - Present
      description:
        - Advisor. <a href="http://www.seas.ucla.edu/spapl/">Prof. Abeer Alwan</a>
        - Researching accent and dialect bias with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, specifically on OpenAI Whisper and African American language (AAL). Focusing on question-answering (QA) extraction using Hugging Face DeBERTa & Meta LLaMA-2 while fine-tuning Whisper with CORAAL.
    - title: Undergraduate Software Engineering Researcher
      institution: Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 
      year: May 2022 - Aug 2022

        - Advisors. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/">Prof. Christian Kästner</a> and <a href="https://bvasiles.github.io/">Prof. Bogdan Vasilescu</a>
        - Developed Python NumPy/Pandas data-mining scripts to determine maintainers of the top 30,000 most popular GHTorrent GitHub repositories. Deduplicated ~5.6 million rows of contributor commit data by merging commit author aliases together and aggregated maintainers based on the definition of contributors responsible for top 80% of total project commits in a year. Identified ~584,000 distinct contributors, and ~110,000 maintainers to be interviewed to understand the motivations behind open-source software maintainers.
    - title: Undergraduate Robotics Researcher
      institution: University of California, Berkeley, California 
      year: June 2021 - Aug 2021
      description:
        - Advisor. <a href="https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/koushil/">Prof. Koushil Sreenath</a>
        - Independently developed a speech interface for a robotic guide dog to facilitate direct, vocal human-robot interaction utilizing Python with AWS Amazon Polly and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text APIs. Allowed for understanding vocal commands and a customizable wake word to activate the guide dog. Navigated based on user’s request by publishing predetermined coordinates to guide dog’s navigation target node. Allowed for independence of guide dog by eliminating the need for a computer to manually send commands to the guide dog by integrating a speech interface into the existing infrastructure utilizing C++ and ROS.
