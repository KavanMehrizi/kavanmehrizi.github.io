In the summer of 2022, I was a part of the REUSE program at Carnegie Mellon University, under Professors <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/">Christian Kästner</a> and <a href="https://bvasiles.github.io/">Bogdan Vasilescu</a> in the Kästner Group and <a href="https://cmustrudel.github.io/">STRUDEL Lab</a>, where my research focused on understanding the motivations behind open-source software maintainers. 

In order to interview maintainers, my role was to figure out who were maintainers of projects on GitHub given a definition of contributors responsible for the top 80% of total project commits in a year. I utilized Python with NumPy and Pandas for the data mining scripts. It was fascinating to apply my coding skills to answering a simple-sounding, but difficult question to objectively answer: what motivates people to maintain open-source projects? This research program has inspired me to pursue a minor in Data Science, a field that I had never known about until this opportunity.
