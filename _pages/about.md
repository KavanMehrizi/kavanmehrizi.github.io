Hi there! 

I'm Kavan and I'm an undergraduate Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) major here at the University of California, Berkeley. I recently worked at American Express as a Data Strategy and Analytics Intern. I've also worked as an undergraduate Machine Learning Researcher at Amazon-UCLA under [Prof. Abeer Alwan](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/spapl/) of the Samueli Electrical and Computer Engineering Department & Amazon-UCLA Science Hub for Humanity and Artificial Intelligence in speech processing. My current interests lie in the ability to use automation to build an increasingly innovative way of life, especially in the role that artificial intelligence can play.

I'm currently open to full time opportunites in an area overall related to the world of software engineering and data science. 

My current interests include human-computer interaction, data science, robotics, and management. When not studying, I love being outside by either photographing, hiking, picnicking, cycling, skiing, or just enjoying nature.
